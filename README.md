# Book-Api-Load-Test

## Project Summary :-
In this project, I tested the load of the URL "https://demoqa.com/bookstore/v1/books" to see how many transactions per second (TPS) it can handle and find out when it starts showing a 1% error rate. I used Apache JMeter to simulate different numbers of users and run tests over a set period. This helped me understand how well the system works under heavy use and where it starts to have performance issues. The results are important for making sure the application can handle real-world traffic smoothly.

## Technology used:-
